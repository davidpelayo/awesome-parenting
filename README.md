# Awesome Parenting
Parenting information & advice for expectant fathers.
The first worldwide collaborative gathering fatherhood resources collection.

# Motivation
It feels to me, although being a difficult topic to discus and agree on, it's useful to have a good amount of information available to query at anytime.

Getting different opinions, resources and books from other parents' recommendations, regardless culture or context, on what are the best parenting practises and guidelines, generally talking, it's always a useful resource to have.
